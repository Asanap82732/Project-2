🚗✨ CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING ✨🚗 📌 Project Description

Car price prediction is a real-world machine learning problem where the goal is to estimate the selling price of a car based on its features such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, ownership, and showroom price.

In this project, we analyze historical car sales data and build a Machine Learning model that predicts the car’s selling price accurately. This system can help buyers, sellers, and dealers make better pricing decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Visualize results

📈 Results & Output

Model Accuracy: ~85–90%

Evaluation Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Visualization:

Actual vs Predicted price comparison graph

✔ The model predicts car prices effectively and demonstrates good performance.

🖼 Sample Output

Scatter plot showing:

X-axis → Actual Selling Price

Y-axis → Predicted Selling Price

Points close to the diagonal line indicate accurate predictions.
